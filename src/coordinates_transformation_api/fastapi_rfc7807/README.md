# README

The source code in this directory is copied from https://github.com/vapor-ware/fastapi-rfc7807, with some modifications to get it to work with pydantic v2.

> **TODO:** current solution is a workaround - the right solution would to fork https://github.com/vapor-ware/fastapi-rfc7807 and create a PR with support for pydantic v2 and use the lib as a pip dependency.
